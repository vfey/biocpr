### Example dataset

Example datasets can be found at `biocpr\data\` or can be obtained from [gitlab](https://github.com/vfey/biocpr/tree/main/data). The dataset has been downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset consisting of [333 patients with primary prostate cancer](https://www.cbioportal.org/study/summary?id=prad_tcga_pub). The dataset was obtained via the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics, and two subsets of the data were created; one containing genes commonly associated with cancer and the other containing 5000 genes selected at random. The subsets are named PrCaTCGASample.txt and PrCaTCGASample_5000.txt, respectively, and provided in the tool repository. For more information on the dataset format, please refer `FAQ`.
