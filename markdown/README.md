### About BioCPR

Correlation analysis is a powerful approach to determine the strength of association between two variables. The strength and direction of a correlation is represented in the form of a correlation coefficient ranging from -1 (negative) to +1 (positive). In cases of biological data such as expression data, establishing a clear pattern can be difficult from just looking at the values. The BioCPR tool has been created to enable researchers to see the results of correlation analysis graphically in the form of an interactive heatmap, which can aid in better understanding of relationships and help identify new patterns.
