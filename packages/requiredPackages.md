### Required R packages

BioCPR is a platform independent tool designed to run on any operating system with R installed. In addition to standard R packages from CRAN and Bioconductor, BioCPR also makes use of few in-house packages which can be found in the `biocpr/packages/` folder. These custom packages are available as source files and can be installed from within RStudio using the Install Packages GUI or using the following command;

```R
install.packages(path_to_package, repos = NULL, type="source")
```
